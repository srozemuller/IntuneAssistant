# How it works

Assignment Manager is built around a **safety-first workflow**. You always see what will change *before* you execute anything—and you always validate after.

<Callout type="info" title="Four-step workflow">
    Upload your desired state in CSV, compare it with the live tenant, choose what to apply, then validate and export results.
</Callout>

<Steps>

    <Step>

        ## 1) Upload CSV

        Provide a CSV describing the assignment changes.

        ```csv
        PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;Filter;Filter Type
        Windows Security Baseline;Finance Department;Include;Add;;
        iOS Compliance Policy;All Users;Include;Replace;Corporate Devices;Include
        Android App Protection;Sales Team;Include;Remove;;
        ```

        During upload, the tool validates:

        - Required columns & data types
        - Obvious conflicts (duplicate rows, invalid actions, etc.)

        If the upload check finds issues, you get immediate feedback to fix them. Only the valid rows are processed in the next step.

    </Step>

    <Step>

        ## 2) Compare (Current vs Planned)

        Each row is evaluated against the live tenant state, so you get a precise preview.

        **Status compare indicators:**

        - <CheckCircle2 className="h-5 w-5 text-green-500 inline" /> **Ready for migration** – Row is ready to implement changes
        - <Circle className="h-5 w-5 text-blue-500 inline" /> **Already migrated** – Row is already in the desired state
        - <AlertTriangle className="h-5 w-5 text-red-500 inline" /> **Check errors** - Row has issues that need fixing before migration. This can due an non existing policy/group, invalid filter, or duplicate policy names.

    </Step>

    <Step>

        ## 3) Select changes (Selective Migration)

        You decide exactly what is applied.

        - Select/deselect operations
        - Batch multiple policies in one run

        <Callout type="warn" title="Recommended for safety">
            Start with a small pilot CSV, then scale up.
        </Callout>

    </Step>

    <Step>

        ## 4) Execute + Validate
        Did you reach the desired state?

        After the run, Assignment Manager validates the final state:

        - Assignments exist as expected
        - Filters are applied correctly
        - Conflicts are detected and surfaced
        - Results are summarized and exportable

    </Step>

## Best-practice patterns

### Use Replace for clean migrations
When moving from one target strategy to another, **Replace** avoids leftover assignments.

### Keep CSVs in version control
Treat migrations as change-controlled artifacts.

### Use filters for exclusions (when possible)
Excluding via filters is usually cleaner than managing parallel exclusion groups.
