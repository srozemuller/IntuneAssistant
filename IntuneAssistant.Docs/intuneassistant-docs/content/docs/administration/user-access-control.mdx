# User Access Control & PIM Integration

IntuneAssistant supports secure multi-user environments through proper access control and integration with Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM).

## Access Control Overview

### Default Behavior
- Only the user who completes onboarding can initially access IntuneAssistant
- The service principal is created with restricted access by default
- Additional users must be explicitly granted access

### Security Principles
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum required access
- **Explicit Assignment**: Never rely on organization-wide consent
- **Role-Based Access**: Use PIM for time-limited administrative access

## User Assignment Methods

### Method 1: Direct User Assignment

1. **Navigate to Microsoft Entra ID**
   - Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) or [Entra Admin Center](https://entra.microsoft.com)
   - Select **Enterprise Applications**

2. **Locate IntuneAssistant Service Principals**
   - Search for "Intune Assistant"
   - You'll find two applications:
     - **Intune Assistant** (Main Application)
     - **Intune Assistant API** (Backend Service)

3. **Assign Users to Both Applications**
