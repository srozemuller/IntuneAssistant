# Add Tenant to MSP Account

Learn how to add customer tenants to your MSP home tenant using GDAP relationships and Partner Center integration.

## Prerequisites

Before adding a tenant, ensure you have:

- **Active GDAP relationship** with the customer tenant in Partner Center
- **Approved delegated admin privileges** for Intune management
- **Customer onboarded** through the regular Intune Assistant onboarding process

<Callout type="warning" title="GDAP Requirement">
    An active partner-tenant GDAP relationship must be established in Partner Center before you can add the tenant to your MSP account.
</Callout>

## Step 1: Customer Onboarding

First, the customer must complete the standard onboarding process:

1. **Customer initiates onboarding**
   - Customer navigates to [Getting Started → Onboarding](/docs/getting-started/onboarding)
   - Follows the standard onboarding workflow
   - Completes tenant registration and authentication setup

2. **Backend tenant creation**
   - This process creates the customer record in the backend
   - Establishes the tenant configuration
   - Sets up the foundation for MSP management

<Callout type="info" title="Customer First">
    The customer must complete their own onboarding first. This ensures proper tenant setup and creates the necessary backend records.
</Callout>

## Step 2: Access MSP Customer Settings

Navigate to your MSP account's customer management area:

1. **Log into your MSP home tenant**
   - Use your primary MSP account credentials
   - Ensure you're in the correct home tenant context

2. **Access customer settings**
   - Go to **Customer Settings** under your MSP account
   - This shows your current managed customer tenants

## Step 3: Add New Tenant

1. **Click "Add Tenant" button**
   - Located in the customer settings interface
   - This opens the tenant addition dialog

2. **Partner Center Integration**
   - The dialog automatically fetches available partner tenants
   - Shows all tenants where you have active GDAP relationships
   - Displays tenant information from Partner Center

3. **Select Customer Tenant**
   - Browse the list of available partner tenants
   - Find the customer tenant you want to add
   - Click on the desired tenant to select it

4. **Confirm Addition**
   - Review the tenant details
   - Confirm the GDAP permissions available
   - Complete the addition process

<Callout type="success" title="Simple Process">
    That's it! Once you click on the tenant, it's automatically added to your MSP account with the available GDAP permissions.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### Tenant Not Appearing in Partner Center List

**Possible causes:**

- Partner Center sync delay

**Solutions:**

- Contact customer to approve pending requests
- Wait for Partner Center synchronization (up to 30 minutes)

### Access Denied After Adding Tenant

**Possible causes:**
- Insufficient GDAP permissions
- Customer revoked delegated privileges
- Role assignments not synchronized

**Solutions:**
- Check delegated admin roles in Partner Center
- Request additional permissions if needed
- Contact customer to verify GDAP approval

### Customer Not Found in Backend

**Possible causes:**
- Customer hasn't completed onboarding
- Backend synchronization pending
- Onboarding process interrupted

**Solutions:**
- Ask customer to complete onboarding first
- Wait for backend processing
- Retry the add tenant process

## Best Practices

### Before Adding Tenants
- **Verify GDAP relationship** is fully established
- **Confirm required permissions** are approved
- **Document customer requirements** and scope

### During Addition Process
- **Select correct tenant** from the list
- **Verify tenant details** before confirming
- **Note available permissions** for future reference

### After Addition
- **Test access** to the new tenant
- **Verify expected functionality** is available
- **Document any limitations** based on GDAP roles

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
    Keep a record of which GDAP roles you have for each customer tenant. This helps troubleshoot permission issues and plan service delivery.
