# Multi-Tenant Overview

Intune Assistant is designed to be a perfect fit for Managed Service Providers (MSPs) who need to manage multiple customer tenants efficiently. With support for GDAP (Granular Delegated Admin Privileges), you can securely access and manage all your customer environments from a single interface.

## Perfect for MSPs

As an MSP, you face unique challenges when managing multiple customer tenants:

- **Context switching** between different customer portals
- **Inconsistent access** across various tenants
- **Time-consuming** manual processes for similar tasks
- **Difficult oversight** of configurations across customers

Intune Assistant solves these challenges by providing:

- **Unified dashboard** for all your customer tenants
- **Consistent experience** across all managed environments
- **Bulk operations** per tenant context in the same portal
- **Centralized reporting** and insights

## How Multi-Tenant Works

### Home Tenant Architecture

Intune Assistant uses a **home tenant** approach where:

1. **Main tenant** serves as your primary management hub, the one where GDAP relationships are established
2. **Customer tenants** are added as additional managed environments
3. **Single sign-on** experience across all tenants
4. **Centralized user management** in your home tenant

### GDAP Integration

Intune Assistant leverages Microsoft's GDAP (Granular Delegated Admin Privileges) for secure customer tenant access:

- **Granular permissions** - Only request the specific permissions you need
- **Time-bound access** - Set expiration dates for enhanced security
- **Customer approval** - Customers maintain control over granted permissions

<Callout type="info" title="GDAP Advantage">
    GDAP provides more secure and granular access compared to traditional delegated admin privileges, giving customers better control over what MSPs can access.
</Callout>

## Setting Up Multi-Tenant Access

### Prerequisites

Before setting up multi-tenant access, ensure you have:

- **Partner Center access** with appropriate permissions
- **GDAP relationships** established with customer tenants
- **Required permissions** granted for Intune management
- **Customer approval** for the necessary delegated privileges
- **Intune Assistant installed** in your home tenant
- **MSP license plan** enabled for Intune Assistant

### Required GDAP Roles

For Intune Assistant functionality, request these GDAP roles:

| Role | Purpose | Permissions |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Intune Service Administrator** | Full Intune management | Read/Write access to all Intune resources |
| **Cloud Device Administrator** | Device management | Manage device settings and compliance |
| **Application Administrator** | App management | Manage application assignments and policies |
| **Reports Reader** | Analytics and reporting | Access to usage and compliance reports |

### Setting Up Customer Tenants

1. **Establish GDAP relationship** in Partner Center (see [GDAP Setup Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/customers/gdap-obtain-admin-permissions-to-manage-customer))
2. **Request appropriate roles** for Intune management (see [GDAP Role Assignment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/customers/gdap-assign-microsoft-entra-roles))
3. **Wait for customer approval** of the delegated privileges (see [GDAP Approval Process](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/customers/gdap-customer-approval))
4. **Add tenant** to Intune Assistant using the customer settings page (see [Adding Customer Tenants](../add-tenant/))

## Features Across Tenants

### Tenant-Specific Views

Switch between tenants while maintaining context:

- **Quick tenant switching** without re-authentication
- **Tenant-specific configurations** and customizations
- **Isolated data** ensuring customer privacy

## Security and Compliance

### Data Isolation

Each customer tenant's data remains completely isolated:

- **No cross-tenant data sharing**
- **Separate authentication contexts**
- **Individual audit trails** per tenant
- **Customer-specific permissions**

### Audit and Monitoring

Comprehensive logging across all operations:

- **GDAP activity logs** for compliance reporting
- **Security event correlation**

### Access Controls

Multiple layers of security:

- **Just-in-time access** through GDAP
- **Role-based permissions** per customer tenant
- **Multi-factor authentication** enforcement
- **Conditional access** policy compliance

<Callout type="warning" title="Security Best Practices">
    Always follow the principle of least privilege when requesting GDAP roles. Only request the minimum permissions necessary for your management tasks.
