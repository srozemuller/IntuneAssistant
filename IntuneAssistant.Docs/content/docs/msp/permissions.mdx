# Multi-Tenant Permissions

Learn about the specific permissions required for MSPs to manage multi-tenant environments, including Partner Center integration and GDAP relationship management.

## Overview

MSP multi-tenant management requires additional permissions beyond standard Intune management to support Partner Center integration, GDAP relationship access, and cross-tenant operations.

## Required MSP Permissions

### Partner Center Access Permissions

For MSP multi-tenant functionality, your MSP account requires:

| Permission | Type | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| `DelegatedAdminRelationship.Read.All` | Application | Read GDAP relationships and partner tenant information |

### Partner Center Authentication

Your MSP account must have:

- **Partner Center access** with appropriate role assignments
- **Ability to view partner tenants** in the Partner Center portal
- **GDAP relationship management** permissions
- **Multi-tenant app registration** in your home tenant

<Callout type="warning" title="Partner Center Requirement">
    You must be able to login to Partner Center and view partner tenants for the multi-tenant functionality to work properly.

### Standard Permissions

In addition to Partner Center permissions, each managed tenant requires a set of standard Microsoft Graph API permissions for Intune management.
The basic Intune Assistant permissions can be found on the [needed permissions](/docs/assistant/permissions) page.

After onboarding new customer (see [add tenant](/docs/administration/multi-tenant/add-tenant)), the correct permissions are set up automatically.
When adding a tenant, the Intune Assistant license is added to the tenant, and the required API permissions are consented. When adding an extra license, a consent prompt is shown to consent the required permissions.
