# Tenant License Management

Learn how to manage licenses for your customer tenants, including adding new licenses and removing existing ones through the customer settings interface.

## Overview

License management allows MSPs to control which features and capabilities are available for each customer tenant. When you add a license, additional permissions may be required through a consent process to ensure proper functionality.

## Managing Tenant Licenses

1. **Navigate to Customer Settings**
   - Go to **Customer Settings** in your MSP account
   - View your list of managed customer tenants

2. **Access Tenant Actions**
   - Find the customer tenant you want to manage
   - Click on the **Actions** button in the tenant row
   - The actions menu will display available options

## Consent Management Process

### When Consent is Required

Consent is typically required when:
- **Adding a new license** that requires additional permissions
- **Upgrading license tiers** with expanded capabilities
- **Enabling new features** that need extra Graph API access
- **First-time setup** of advanced functionalities

### Consent Workflow

1. **Consent Request Triggered**
   - System identifies required permissions for the new license
   - Consent dialog appears with permission details
   - Clear explanation of why permissions are needed

2. **Admin Consent Required**
   - Global Administrator or appropriate admin role needed
   - Review of requested permissions and their impact
   - Decision to grant or deny the consent request

3. **Permission Activation**
   - Once consent is granted, permissions are activated
   - License features become available immediately
   - User can access newly enabled capabilities

<Callout type="tip" title="Consent Best Practice">
    Review the permissions requested during consent carefully. Only grant permissions that are necessary for the intended license features.
</Callout>

## License Status Indicators

In the tenants list, license status is indicated with icons:

- **No Consent needed**: <CheckCircle className="inline h-4 w-4 text-green-500" /> - Indicates no license is assigned
- **Consent needed**: <AlertCircle className="inline h-4 w-4 text-red-500" /> - Indicates consent is required for the license

### Consent license
If a license requires consent, you will see the red alert icon as show above. To provide consent go to the tenant using the action button and use the Grant Consent button.
