# Switch Tenants

Learn how to quickly switch between customer tenants in your MSP environment to manage multiple customer environments from a single interface.

## Overview

The tenant switching functionality allows MSPs to seamlessly move between different customer environments without losing context or requiring separate logins. This streamlines your workflow when managing multiple customer tenants.

## How to Switch Tenants

### Step 1: Navigate to Customer Settings

1. **Access your MSP home tenant**
   - Ensure you're logged into your primary MSP account
   - Navigate to the main dashboard

2. **Go to Customer Settings**
   - Click on **Customer Settings** in your MSP account menu
   - This displays all your managed customer tenants

### Step 2: Select Target Tenant

1. **Locate the customer tenant**
   - Browse through your list of managed customer tenants
   - Find the tenant you want to switch to

2. **Access tenant actions**
   - Click on the **Actions** button in the tenant row
   - This opens the available actions for that specific tenant

### Step 3: Switch to Tenant

1. **Click "Select Tenant"**
   - From the actions menu, click **Select Tenant**
   - The system will initiate the tenant switch process

2. **Automatic context switch**
   - The interface automatically updates to show the selected tenant
   - All subsequent operations will be performed in the selected tenant context

## What Happens During Tenant Switch

### Authentication Context
- **GDAP authentication** is applied for the selected tenant
- **Delegated permissions** are activated automatically
- **User context** is maintained throughout the switch

### Interface Updates
- **Tenant indicator** shows current active tenant
- **Data context** switches to the selected tenant
- **Navigation menus** reflect tenant-specific options

### Permission Application
- **Role-based access** is applied based on GDAP configuration
- **Scope limitations** are enforced automatically
- **Audit trail** records the tenant switch activity

## Current Tenant Indicator

After switching tenants, you can identify your current context through:

- **Tenant name** displayed in the interface header
- **Tenant-specific branding** if configured
- **Context indicators** throughout the interface
- **Breadcrumb navigation** showing current tenant

## Best Practices

### Before Switching
- **Complete current operations** in the active tenant
- **Save any pending changes** to avoid data loss
- **Note the target tenant** to ensure correct selection

### During Operations
- **Verify tenant context** before making changes
- **Use tenant indicators** to confirm active environment
- **Be mindful of cross-tenant operations**

### Security Considerations
- **Verify permissions** in the new tenant context
- **Check GDAP status** if access issues occur
- **Log out completely** when finishing work

## Switching Back to Home Tenant

To return to your MSP home tenant:

1. **Access Customer Settings** again
2. **Look for "Home Tenant"** option in the interface
3. **Click to return** to your primary MSP context

Or use the tenant selector if available in the main navigation.

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Switch to Tenant

**Possible causes:**
- GDAP relationship expired or revoked
- Customer disabled delegated access
- Network connectivity issues

**Solutions:**
- Check GDAP status in Partner Center
- Contact customer to verify permissions
- Refresh the page and try again

### Tenant Not Responding

**Possible causes:**
- Tenant-specific service issues
- GDAP permission synchronization delay
- Network or authentication problems

**Solutions:**
- Wait a few minutes and retry
- Check Microsoft service health
- Verify internet connectivity

### Wrong Tenant Context

**If you're in the wrong tenant:**
- Immediately stop any operations
- Switch to the correct tenant using the same process
- Verify current context before proceeding
