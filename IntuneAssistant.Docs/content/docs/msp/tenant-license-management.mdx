## Consent Management Process

### When Consent is Required

Consent is typically required when:

- **Upgrading license tiers** with expanded capabilities
- **Enabling new features** that need extra Graph API access
- **First-time setup** of advanced functionalities

### Consent Workflow

1. **Consent Request Triggered**
   - System identifies required permissions for the new license
   - Consent dialog appears with permission details
   - Clear explanation of why permissions are needed

2. **Admin Consent Required**
   - Global Administrator or appropriate admin role needed
   - Review of requested permissions and their impact
   - Decision to grant or deny the consent request

3. **Permission Activation**
   - Once consent is granted, permissions are activated
   - License features become available immediately
   - User can access newly enabled capabilities

<Callout type="tip" title="Consent Best Practice">
    Review the permissions requested during consent carefully. Only grant permissions that are necessary for the intended license features.

## Troubleshooting

### Consent Process Fails

## Best Practices
