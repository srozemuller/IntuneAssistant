# Data & Privacy Policy

Intune Assistant is built with privacy by design. Our core principle is that **your data stays in your tenant** - we process everything in memory and store only the absolute minimum required for licensing and identification.

## Our Privacy Commitment

<Callout type="success" title="Zero Data Extraction">
    **No data leaves your tenant.** All Intune and Graph API data is processed in memory only and never stored or transmitted to external systems.
</Callout>

## Data Storage & Processing Overview

### Minimal Data Storage Approach

We follow a strict minimal data storage policy with complete transparency about what we store and why:

| Data Type | Stored | Purpose | Retention |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Tenant ID** | ✅ Yes | Identify tenant and enforce fair-usage licensing | Persistent |
| **Tenant Domain** | ✅ Yes | Display and licensing identification | Persistent |
| **Session Data** (tokens, settings) | ❌ No | Stored only in browser session storage | Temporary |
| **Intune Data** | ❌ No | Processed in memory only, never persisted | N/A |
| **Graph API Data** | ❌ No | Processed in memory only, never persisted | N/A |
| **Device Information** | ❌ No | Never accessed or stored | N/A |
| **User Personal Data** | ❌ No | Never accessed or stored | N/A |
| **Configuration Data** | ❌ No | Never stored outside your tenant | N/A |

## What We DON'T Store

### Personal & Sensitive Data
- ❌ **No user personal data** - names, emails, or personal information
- ❌ **No device information** - device details, serial numbers, or hardware data
- ❌ **No configuration data** - policies, settings, or tenant configurations
- ❌ **No authentication tokens** - no persistent storage of access credentials
- ❌ **No usage analytics** - no tracking of user behavior or application usage
- ❌ **No tenant content** - no documents, files, or user-generated content

### Technical Data
- ❌ **No API responses** - Graph API data processed and discarded immediately
- ❌ **No caching** - no persistent caching of any tenant data
- ❌ **No logs** - no logging of tenant-specific operations or data
- ❌ **No backups** - no backup copies of any tenant information

## How We Process Your Data

### Data Flow Principles

1. **Request Processing**
   - API calls made directly to your tenant's Graph API
   - Data retrieved and processed in memory only
   - Results displayed immediately to your browser

2. **No Persistence**
   - API responses processed and immediately discarded
   - No database storage of any tenant-specific data
   - No caching beyond browser session storage

3. **Session Management**
   - Authentication tokens stored only in browser session
   - Session data cleared automatically on logout
   - No server-side session persistence

<Callout type="info" title="Browser Session Storage">
    We use browser session storage for temporary data like UI preferences and navigation state. This data is automatically cleared when you close your browser or log out.
</Callout>

## Data Security Measures

### Technical Safeguards

- **HTTPS Encryption** - All communications encrypted in transit
- **No Database Storage** - No persistent storage of tenant data
- **Memory-Only Processing** - All operations performed in volatile memory
- **Automatic Cleanup** - Memory cleared after each operation
- **Session Isolation** - Each session completely isolated from others

### Access Controls

- **Microsoft Identity** - Authentication through your tenant's identity provider
- **GDAP Compliance** - Granular delegated admin privileges for MSPs
- **Role-Based Access** - Permissions enforced through your tenant's RBAC

## MSP Privacy Considerations

### Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

For MSP environments, we ensure complete data isolation:

- **GDAP Respect** - Only access data according to granted permissions
- **Audit Trail** - All tenant switches and operations logged appropriately

### Customer Data Protection

- **Customer Consent** - All access based on explicit GDAP permissions
- **Limited Scope** - Only access data necessary for granted roles
- **No Data Sharing** - No sharing of customer data between tenants or MSPs
- **Transparent Access** - Clear audit trail of all MSP activities

## Your Rights and Controls

### Data Control

- **Full Control** - You maintain complete control over your tenant data
- **Access Management** - Control application access through Azure AD
- **Permission Granularity** - Grant only necessary permissions
- **Revoke Access** - Instantly revoke application access at any time

### Transparency

- **Clear Documentation** - Complete transparency about data handling
- **No Hidden Processes** - All data processing clearly documented
- **Regular Updates** - Privacy policy updates communicated clearly

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Privacy Questions

**Q: Where is my data stored?**
A: Your data is never stored outside your tenant. We only store tenant ID and domain for licensing purposes. All other data remains in your Microsoft tenant.

**Q: Can you see my Intune configurations?**
A: No, we never store or log your Intune data. We only process it in memory to display it to you, then immediately discard it.

A: Only your tenant ID and domain are stored for licensing. There's no other data to delete. You can request removal of licensing data by contacting support.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How do you handle authentication tokens?**
A: Authentication tokens are stored only in your browser's session storage and are never transmitted to our servers or stored persistently.

**Q: Is my data encrypted?**
A: All communication is encrypted via HTTPS. Since we don't store your data, there's no data at rest to encrypt.

**Q: Can other users see my data?**
