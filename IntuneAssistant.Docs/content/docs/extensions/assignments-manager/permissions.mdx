# Permissions Overview

Learn how to configure the required permissions for the Intune Assistant Assignments Manager extension and how to set up granular permissions for users in your organization.

## Required Graph API Permissions

The Assignments Manager extension requires the following Microsoft Graph API permissions to function properly:

| Permission | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| `DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All` | Delegated | Read and write Intune configuration profiles and baselines |
| `DeviceManagementApps.ReadWrite.All` | Delegated | Read and write managed applications and app configurations |
| `DeviceManagementServiceConfig.ReadWrite.All` | Delegated | Read and write device management service configuration |
| `DeviceManagementScripts.ReadWrite.All` | Delegated | Read and write PowerShell and shell scripts |
| `Group.Read.All` | Delegated | Read group memberships and properties |


<Callout type="warning" title="ReadWrite permissions required">
    The Assignments Manager extension requires **ReadWrite** permissions to modify policy assignments, group assignments, and filters in your Intune tenant.
</Callout>

## Configuring Granular User Permissions

Instead of giving users full Intune Administrator permissions, you can configure granular role-based access control (RBAC) permissions for the Assignments Manager functionality.

### Understanding Intune RBAC

Microsoft Intune uses role-based access control to determine what actions users can perform. Each role contains:

- **Permissions**: What actions can be performed
- **Scope**: Which resources the role applies to
- **Assignments**: Which users or groups have the role

### Required Intune Roles for Assignments Manager

Users need roles with **read and write permissions** for the following categories:

#### Policy and Profile Manager
Allows reading and modifying device configuration profiles and compliance policies.

**Required permissions:**
- Device configuration policies: **Read, Create, Update, Delete, Assign**
- Device compliance policies: **Read, Create, Update, Delete, Assign**
- Device enrollment: **Read**

#### Application Configuration Manager
Allows reading and modifying application management data.

**Required permissions:**
- Mobile applications: **Read, Create, Update, Delete, Assign**
- Mobile application management policies: **Read, Create, Update, Delete, Assign**

#### Script Manager
Allows reading and modifying PowerShell and shell scripts.

**Required permissions:**
- Device management scripts: **Read, Create, Update, Delete, Assign**

#### Group Reader
Allows reading group information for assignment purposes.

**Required permissions:**
- Groups: **Read**

### Creating a Custom Role

For optimal security, create a custom role with only the required permissions:

1. **Navigate to Microsoft Intune admin center**
   - Go to [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431)
   - Select **Tenant administration** > **Roles** > **All roles**

2. **Create new role**
   - Click **Create**
   - Enter role name: `Intune Assignments Manager`
   - Add description: `Manage assignments for Intune policies, apps, and scripts`

3. **Configure permissions**
   - **Device configuration policies**: Read, Create, Update, Delete, Assign ✓
   - **Device compliance policies**: Read, Create, Update, Delete, Assign ✓
   - **Mobile applications**: Read, Create, Update, Delete, Assign ✓
   - **Mobile application management policies**: Read, Create, Update, Delete, Assign ✓
   - **Device management scripts**: Read, Create, Update, Delete, Assign ✓
   - **Organization**: Read ✓

4. **Set scope and assignments**
   - Define which users/groups should have this role
   - Set appropriate scope tags if needed

### Built-in Roles Alternative

If you prefer using built-in roles, assign users to:

- **Intune Service Administrator** (full read/write access)
- **Application Administrator** (for app-related assignments only)

<Callout type="info" title="Recommended approach">
    We recommend creating a custom role with only the required assignment permissions to follow the principle of least privilege.

## Assignment Operations

The Assignments Manager extension performs the following operations:

### Policy Assignment Management
- **Assign policies** to groups with include/exclude logic
- **Remove assignments** from existing policies
- **Modify assignment filters** and conditions
- **Bulk assignment operations** across multiple policies

### Application Assignment Management
- **Assign applications** to users and devices
- **Configure installation requirements** and deadlines
- **Manage app protection policies** assignments
- **Handle app configuration** policy assignments

### Script Assignment Management
- **Assign PowerShell scripts** to device groups
- **Configure script execution** parameters
- **Manage shell scripts** for macOS devices

<Callout type="warning" title="Assignment impact">
    Changes made through the Assignments Manager directly affect your production environment. Always test in a non-production environment first.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

Common permission issues:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Cannot modify assignments | Verify user has ReadWrite permissions for the specific resource type |
| Assignment operations fail | Check if user has "Assign" permission in their Intune role |
| Cannot see target groups | Ensure `Group.Read.All` permission is granted |
| Script assignments fail | Verify `DeviceManagementScripts.ReadWrite.All` permission |

## Consent missing

The Assignments Manager requires admin consent for the Graph API permissions. Ensure that a Global Administrator has granted consent for the application in your tenant.

New features may require additional permissions. If required consent is missing, you will be notified. Then run the consent process again.

For information about that process, check the [Managing Admin Consent](/docs/getting-started/consent-management/) documentation.

## Security Considerations

When granting permissions for the Assignments Manager:

- **Limit scope** using scope tags to restrict access to specific organizational units
- **Regular auditing** of assignment changes through Intune audit logs
- **Monitor usage** to ensure permissions are being used appropriately
- **Implement approval workflows** for critical assignment changes
