# Create Assignment Templates

Assignment Manager uses CSV files to define your desired assignment state. You can create these templates in two ways: manually from scratch or by exporting from an existing reference tenant.

---

## Method 1: Manual CSV Creation

Create your own CSV file from scratch using any spreadsheet application or text editor.

<Callout type="info" title="Download Blank Template">
    Start with a ready-to-use template: [Blank Template CSV](/assets/blank-assignment-template.csv)
</Callout>

### When to use manual creation

- **New standardization projects** - Building fresh assignment patterns
- **Custom requirements** - Need specific assignment combinations
- **Template-driven approach** - Creating reusable templates for multiple tenants
- **Precise control** - Want to define exact assignment states

### Getting started

1. Create a new CSV file with semicolon separators (or download here: [Blank Template CSV](/assets/blank-assignment-template.csv))
2. Add the required column headers
3. Define your desired assignment states row by row
4. Save and upload to Assignment Manager

---

## CSV File Format

### Required Columns

| Column Name | Description | Required | Example |
|------------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `PolicyName` | Name of the Intune policy | Yes | "Windows Security Baseline" |
| `GroupName` | Azure AD group name or special target | Yes | "All Users", "All Devices", "Finance Team" |
| `AssignmentDirection` | Assignment direction | Yes | "Include", "Exclude" |
| `AssignmentAction` | Action to perform | Yes | "Add", "Remove", "Replace", "NoAssignment" |
| `Filter` | Name of assignment filter (optional) | No | "Windows 11 Devices" |
| `Filter Type` | Filter direction (optional) | No | "Include", "Exclude" |

### CSV Example

```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;Filter;Filter Type
Windows Security Baseline;Finance Team;Include;Add;;
Windows Security Baseline;All Users;Include;Replace;;
Compliance Policy 1;Sales Team;Include;Add;Windows 11 Devices;Include
Compliance Policy 1;Marketing Team;Include;Add;Test Devices;Exclude
Old Policy;Finance Team;Include;Remove;;
```

## Method 2: Export from Reference Tenant

Use this method to create templates based on existing, properly configured tenants.

<Steps>

<Step>

### Navigate to Assignment Overview

1. Go to [Assignment Overview](https://intuneassistant.cloud/assistant/assignments-overview/) in your reference tenant
2. Click **Load Assignments** to fetch current assignment data

This loads all current policy assignments from your tenant, including assignment filters and exclusions.

</Step>

<Step>

### Export to CSV

1. Click the **Export** button
2. Under "Export for Bulk Assignments", choose **Export to CSV**
3. The file downloads with all current assignments in the correct format

The exported CSV includes:
- All current policy assignments
- Assignment filters (if any)
- Proper column formatting
- Ready-to-use structure

</Step>

<Step>

### Review and Modify
If needed, edit the downloaded CSV to match your target requirements:

**Example: Change assignment actions:**
- Change `Add` to `NoAssignment` for cleanup assignments from a policy
- Add `Remove` actions for policies you want to unassign

**Update target groups:**
- Replace specific groups with `All Users` or `All Devices` for standardization
- Add or remove exclusion groups

**Adjust filters:**
- Update filter names to match your target tenant
- Remove filter columns if not needed

</Step>

</Steps>

### When to use export method

- **Existing reference tenant** - You have a properly configured tenant to model
- **Quick standardization** - Want to replicate current assignments across tenants
- **Incremental changes** - Need to modify existing assignment patterns
- **MSP workflows** - Deploying proven configurations to customer tenants

## Template Modification Examples

### Converting Export to Standardization Template

**Scenario:** You exported assignments from a pilot tenant and want to create a standardized template for all customers.

**Original export (multiple specific groups):**

```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;Filter;Filter Type
Security Baseline;IT Admins;Include;Add;;
Security Baseline;Finance Team;Include;Add;;
Security Baseline;Sales Team;Include;Add;;
```
**Modified for standardization:**
This replaces all specific group assignments with a single assignment to All Users.

```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;Filter;Filter Type
Security Baseline;All Users;Include;Replace;;
```
### Adding Safety Exclusions

**Scenario:** Add test user exclusions to prevent policies from affecting test accounts.

**Original assignment:**

```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;Filter;Filter Type
Compliance Policy;All Users;Include;Add;;
```
**Modified with exclusions:**

```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;Filter;Filter Type
Compliance Policy;Test Users;Exclude;Add;;
```
### Removing Unwanted Assignments

**Scenario:** Remove assignments from legacy policies during cleanup.

**Template for removing all assignments:**

```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;Filter;Filter Type
Legacy Policy;;;NoAssignment;;
Old Compliance Policy;;;NoAssignment;;
```

## Best Practices

### For MSPs

- **Create master templates** for each customer type or service tier
- **Use Replace actions** to ensure consistent state across customer tenants
- **Test templates** on a pilot customer before wide deployment
- **Version control** your templates for change tracking

### For Enterprises

- **Export from production** reference environments when possible
- **Modify gradually** - don't change everything at once
- **Document templates** with clear naming and versioning
- **Test in development** before applying to production

### General Guidelines

- **Start small** - test with 1-2 policies first
- **Validate before upload** - check policy names, group names, and filters exist
- **Keep templates organized** - use descriptive filenames
- **Plan rollback** - know how to reverse changes if needed (see Backup and restore guide)[/docs/extensions/assignments-manager/backup-and-restore]

## Template Validation

Before uploading your template, verify:

- **Policy names** match exactly (case-sensitive)
- **Group names** exist in the target tenant
- **Filter names** exist and match the policy platform
- **Actions and directions** use valid values
- **No conflicting operations** in the same batch

<Callout type="tip" title="Validation happens during upload">
    Assignment Manager validates your template during upload and shows you exactly what issues need fixing before proceeding.
