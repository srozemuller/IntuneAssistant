# Assignments Manager - Scenarios

## Overview
We have tested various common scenarios for managing Microsoft Intune policy assignments using the Assignments Manager.
This guide provides detailed examples and explanations for each scenario, helping you understand how to effectively use the tool for your specific needs.

The Assignments Manager allows you to manage Microsoft Intune policy assignments in bulk using CSV files and reach a desired assignments state for your policies.

You can add, remove, replace or clear assignments for policies across different tenants.

---

## Supported Operations

The tool supports four primary actions:

- **Add** - Add new assignments to existing policies
- **Remove** - Remove specific assignments from policies
- **Replace** - Replace all existing assignments with new ones
- **NoAssignment** - Remove all assignments using the NoAssignment action

### Filter Platform Matching

<Callout type="warn" title="Important">
    Filter platform must match the policy platform.
</Callout>

|----------------|---------------------------|
| Windows | Windows |
| iOS | iOS |
| Android | Android |
| macOS | macOS |

---

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Migrate Policy from One Group to Another

**Goal:** Move policy from "Pilot Users" to "All Users"

**CSV:**
```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;FilterName;FilterType
New Feature Policy;All Users;Include;Replace;;
```

**Result:** All previous assignments removed, policy now assigned to "All Users"

---

### Scenario 2: Add Exclusion to Existing Assignment

**Goal:** Keep current assignments but exclude test devices

**CSV:**
```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;FilterName;FilterType
Compliance Policy;All Devices;Exclude;Add;Test Devices;Exclude
```

**Result:** Policy applies to all devices except those matching "Test Devices" filter

---

### Scenario 3: Change Filter Direction

**Goal:** Change from excluding test devices to including only production devices

**CSV:**
```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;FilterName;FilterType
Security Policy;All Devices;Include;Replace;Production Devices;Include
```

**Result:** All previous assignments removed, policy now applies only to production devices

---

### Scenario 4: Batch Migration Multiple Policies

**CSV:**
```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;FilterName;FilterType
Policy A;Finance Team;Include;Replace;;
Policy B;Finance Team;Include;Replace;;
Policy C;Finance Team;Include;Replace;;
Policy D;All Users;Include;Replace;;
```

**Result:** Multiple policies migrated to new assignments in one operation

---

### Scenario 5: Replace and Add Exclusion

**Goal:** Replace assignment and immediately add exclusion group

**CSV:**
```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;FilterName;FilterType
App Protection;All Users;Include;Replace;;
App Protection;Excluded Users;Exclude;Add;;
```

**Processing Order:**
1. Replace removes all assignments and adds "All Users"
2. Add includes "Excluded Users" group

<Callout type="warn" title="Note">
    This creates two assignments — you may want to use filters instead for exclusions.
</Callout>

---

## Validation Rules

### Rule 1: Cannot Mix All Users/All Devices with Groups

<Callout type="error" title="Invalid">
    Cannot mix **All Users / All Devices** with group assignments in the same policy batch.
</Callout>

❌ **Invalid:**
```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;FilterName;FilterType
My Policy;All Users;Include;Add;;
My Policy;Finance Team;Include;Add;;
```

**Error:** "Cannot mix 'All Users' with group assignments"

✅ **Solution (use Replace):**
```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;FilterName;FilterType
My Policy;All Users;Include;Replace;;
```

---

### Rule 2: Filter Platform Must Match Policy Platform

❌ **Invalid:**
```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;FilterName;FilterType
Windows Security Baseline;All Devices;Include;Add;iOS Device Filter;Include
```

**Error:** "Filter platform 'iOS' does not match policy platform 'Windows'"

✅ **Valid:**
```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;FilterName;FilterType
Windows Security Baseline;All Devices;Include;Add;Windows 11 Filter;Include
```

---

### Rule 3: Cannot Have Conflicting Actions in Same Batch

❌ **Invalid:**
```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;FilterName;FilterType
My Policy;Finance Team;Include;Add;;
My Policy;Finance Team;Include;Remove;;
```

**Error:** "Conflicting assignment actions detected for the same assignment"

**Reason:** Adding and removing the same assignment in one batch creates a conflict.

---

### Rule 4: Cannot Add Same Assignment with Different Filters

❌ **Invalid:**
```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;FilterName;FilterType
My Policy;IT Team;Include;Add;Filter A;Include
My Policy;IT Team;Include;Add;Filter B;Exclude
```

**Error:** "Conflicting filter types for the same assignment"

**Reason:** Same group cannot have both Include and Exclude filters simultaneously.

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Before Production

Always test your CSV with a small subset of policies first:

```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;FilterName;FilterType
Test Policy 1;Test Group;Include;Add;;
```

### 2. Use Replace for Clean Migrations

When migrating policies, use **Replace** to avoid orphaned assignments:

```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;FilterName;FilterType
Production Policy;Production Users;Include;Replace;;
```

### 3. Verify Group Names

Ensure group names match exactly (case-sensitive):

❌ `finance team` ≠ `Finance Team`
✅ `Finance Team` = `Finance Team`

### 4. Check Filter Names

Filter names must exist in your tenant before migration:

```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;FilterName;FilterType
My Policy;All Devices;Include;Add;Corporate Devices;Include
```

Verify "Corporate Devices" filter exists first.

### 5. Batch Similar Operations

Group similar operations together:

```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;FilterName;FilterType
Policy 1;Finance;Include;Replace;;
Policy 2;Finance;Include;Replace;;
Policy 3;Finance;Include;Replace;;
```

### 6. Order of Operations

When using multiple actions, they execute in CSV row order:

```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;FilterName;FilterType
My Policy;All Users;Include;Replace;;
My Policy;Excluded Group;Exclude;Add;;
```

**Result:**
1. Replace removes all assignments and adds "All Users"
2. Add includes "Excluded Group"

## Error Messages

| Error Message | Cause | Solution |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| "Policy not found" | Policy name doesn't exist | Verify policy name spelling |
| "Group not found" | Group name doesn't exist | Check Entra ID group name |
| "Filter not found" | Filter name doesn't exist | Verify assignment filter exists |
| "Platform mismatch" | Filter platform ≠ policy platform | Use matching platform filter |
| "Cannot mix assignment types" | Mixing All Users/Devices with groups | Use Replace action |
| "Conflicting actions" | Same assignment has Add + Remove | Remove duplicate |

---

## Examples by Policy Type

### Configuration Policies

```

## MSP Scenario Examples


### New Customer Onboarding (MSPs)
You have used other tools like Inforcer, Coreview or just added all those policies manually in a customer tenant.
Now you can use the Assignments Manager to user your standardized assignment template from your pilot tenant and use it for future customers.
```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;Filter;Filter Type
Windows Security Baseline;All Devices;Include;Replace;;
iOS Compliance Policy;All Users;Include;Replace;;
Android App Protection;All Users;Include;Replace;;
BYOD Compliance;All Users;Include;Replace;Corporate Devices;Exclude
```
---

### Pilot to Production Migration
You have new policies added to a tenant and want to test it in a pilot group first.
```csv
PolicyName;GroupName;AssignmentDirection;AssignmentAction;Filter;Filter Type
Old Feature Policy;Pilot Group;Exclude;Add;;
New Feature Policy;Pilot Group;Include;Add;;
```
---

## FAQ

**Q: What happens if I add the same assignment twice?**
A: The operation is idempotent - only one assignment is created.

**Q: Can I remove an assignment that doesn't exist?**
A: No, during compare phase it checks if the assignment exists. If it doesn't exist it is not ready for migration.

**Q: Can I use Replace multiple times in one CSV?**
A: Yes, but each Replace overwrites the previous one for that policy.

**Q: Can I migrate assignments between tenants?**
A: No, group and filter names must exist in the target tenant.

**Q: What happens if a filter name is wrong?**
A: Error: "Assignment filter not found" - operation fails for that row.
