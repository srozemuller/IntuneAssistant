# Permissions Overview

Learn how to configure the required permissions for Intune Assistant and how to set up granular permissions for users in your organization.

## Required Graph API Permissions

Intune Assistant requires the following Microsoft Graph API permissions to function properly:

| Permission | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| `DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All` | Delegated | Read Intune configuration profiles and baselines |
| `DeviceManagementApps.Read.All` | Delegated | Read managed applications and app configurations |
| `DeviceManagementServiceConfig.Read.All` | Delegated | Read device management service configuration |
| `DeviceManagementScripts.Read.All` | Delegated | Read PowerShell and shell scripts |
| `Group.Read.All` | Delegated | Read group memberships and properties |
| `User.ReadBasic.All` | Delegated | Read basic user information like name and email |
| `Directory.AccessAsUser.All` | Delegated only | Access directory data on behalf of the user |
| `Policy.Read.ConditionalAccess` | Delegated | Read Conditional Access policies |

    All permissions listed above are **READ-ONLY** permissions. Intune Assistant never modifies your tenant configuration.

## Configuring Granular User Permissions

Instead of giving users full Intune Administrator permissions, you can configure granular role-based access control (RBAC) permissions. This follows the principle of least privilege.

### Understanding Intune RBAC

Microsoft Intune uses role-based access control to determine what actions users can perform. Each role contains:

- **Permissions**: What actions can be performed
- **Scope**: Which resources the role applies to
- **Assignments**: Which users or groups have the role

### Required Intune Roles for Intune Assistant

Since Intune Assistant only reads data, users need roles with **read permissions** for the following categories:

#### Device Configuration Reader
Allows reading device configuration profiles and compliance policies.

**Required permissions:**
- Device configuration policies: **Read**
- Device compliance policies: **Read**
- Device enrollment: **Read**

#### Application Reader
Allows reading application management data.

**Required permissions:**
- Mobile applications: **Read**
- Mobile application management policies: **Read**

#### Reports Reader
Allows reading reports and analytics data.

**Required permissions:**
- Reports: **Read**

#### Conditional Access Reader
Allows reading Conditional Access policies.

**Required permissions:**
- Conditional Access: **Read**

### Creating a Custom Role

For optimal security, create a custom role with only the required read permissions:

1. **Navigate to Microsoft Intune admin center**
   - Go to [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431)
   - Select **Tenant administration** > **Roles** > **All roles**

2. **Create new role**
   - Click **Create**
   - Enter role name: `Intune Assistant Reader`
   - Add description: `Read-only access for Intune Assistant users`

3. **Configure permissions**
   - **Device configuration policies**: Read ✓
   - **Device compliance policies**: Read ✓
   - **Device enrollment**: Read ✓
   - **Mobile applications**: Read ✓
   - **Mobile application management policies**: Read ✓
   - **Reports**: Read ✓
   - **Organization**: Read ✓

4. **Set scope and assignments**
   - Define which users/groups should have this role
   - Set appropriate scope tags if needed

### Built-in Roles Alternative

If you prefer using built-in roles, assign users to:

- **Intune Service Administrator** (full read/write - not recommended)
- **Reports Reader** (limited to reports only)
- **Global Reader** (read access across Microsoft 365)

<Callout type="info" title="Recommended approach">
    We recommend creating a custom role with only the required read permissions to follow the principle of least privilege.

## Troubleshooting

Common permission issues:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| User cannot see any data | Check if user has required Intune role assigned |
| Missing device configurations | Verify `DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All` permission |
| Missing applications | Check `DeviceManagementApps.Read.All` permission |


## Consent missing
Intune Assistant requires admin consent for the Graph API permissions. Ensure that a Global Administrator has granted consent for the application in your tenant.
New features may require additional permissions, if a required consent is missing you will get notified. Then run the consent again.

For information about that process, check the [Managing Admin Consent](/docs/getting-started/consent-management/) documentation.

    Regularly review and audit user permissions to ensure they align with current job responsibilities and security requirements.
